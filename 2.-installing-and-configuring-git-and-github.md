### Installing and configuring git and github for your web projects

When we are working in a software projects, it's necessary have order to work and control of all of source or code, 
also we need working in teams and documenting all changes, if something fail, return to the last version. 
All this may sounds complicated but, always we have tools that allow us to streamline these processes and 
*Git* and *Github* help us with that.

#### What's Git and Github?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system for software projects.

[Github](https://github.com/) is a hosting service in the cloud for software projects based on git.

#### Installing Git

**On Mac** 

We need download the .dmg file [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) after that open the file and install it.

If you have installed [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) use the following command:

```brew install git```

Open the terminal and check if git are installed correctly:

```git --version```

**On Linux (Debian based distribution like Ubuntu)**

Run the following command in your terminal:

```apt-get install git```

After that, check if git are installed with ```git --version```.

**On Windows**

Installing Git on Windows is very easy, only we need to download git [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) 
and execute the .exe file, following the steps of installer.

##### Create an account on Github

Create an account on Github is easy as creating a profile on a social network like facebook
or twitter, so we go to the github's website [github.com](https://github.com/).

Press *Sign Up* button and fill all the fields requesting you.

You have now an account of github, I invite you to explore projects, other users, options, edit your profile, etc.

##### Configure git on your computer

Now, we need to configure all on our computer for start working, so open your terminal and follow me:

**a)** We position ourselves in the folder *.ssh* 

```
cd ~/.ssh
```

**b)** We create an ssh key to connect our computer to github.

```ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@yourdomain.com"```

**c)** It generates a *id_rsa.pub* file and indicates the direction where it is.

**d)** Open the *id_rsa.pub* file and copy the content:

```sudo vim id_rsa.pub```

**e)** We head to github account and press in **Profile > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key button**, 
we enter a title and paste the ssh key that we copied earlier in our computer and press *Add SSH*.

**d)** We returned to the terminal and run the following command to test the connection:

```ssh git@github.com```

If everything Okay, show us the message of successful connection.

**e)** Configure global variables

Set the user name:

```git config --global user.name "Name lastname"```

Set the email:

```git config --global user.email "email@domain.com"```

Set github user: 

```git config  --global github.user usergithub```

**d)** Set the token (On github enter to Profile/Settings/Personal token access/Generate new token and copy that in the command)

```git config –global github.token ExAmPlETokenAhrTRff```

Congratulations! you have Git and Github installed and configured.

##### Your first repository

The repositories are deposits or folders where we can store our files of our projects. We created a github repository 
manually, as if we created a folder, we do this on github, to do this, go to **Profile > Repositories > New > Put the 
name of repository (myrepository)> Create Repository**.

**a)** Now, go to the terminal and create a folder with the same name seen before:

```mkdir myrepository && cd myrepository```

**b)** We write the next command to link our directory with the repository on github.

```git init```

**c)** Add the README file.

```Touch README```

**d)** Prepare the file to upload.

```git add README```

**e)** We prepare the file and you write a comment.

```git commit –m "Add README file"```

**f)** Prepare to indicate where we will get into our github repository.

```git remote add origin git@github.com:usergithub/myrepository.git```

**g)** We ship all the changes.

```git push origin master```

##### Remember

Well, now have install and configure git in our computer for use this powerful control version system but, this 
does not end here. There are many interesting things we can do to streamline our work on our projects using git and 
github. "Practice makes a master", so we need check the documentation of git and practice, 
I invite you to consult the official documentation [git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs).

**Keep in Calm and improve yourself**
