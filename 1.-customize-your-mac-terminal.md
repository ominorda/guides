## Customize in 3 steps your Mac terminal with OhMyZsh

Sometimes our terminal by default on Mac is boring and not very colorful, so in this post you will learn how to customize 
your terminal and the best of all, to do this in 3 steps, very simple right?

#### What the hell is Zsh and OhMyZsh?

According to the sites of Zsh and OhMyZsh: 

* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) - Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use.

* [OhMyZsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for 
managing your zsh configuration.

#### Why to do this?

Personally, I use the terminal for everything, opening files, create a lot of projects using git as version control, 
bower and npm for dependencies, server configuration, application deployments, etc. This tool is very helpful in our 
daily work. So let's start!

#### Prerequisites

You must have installed:
* Zsh
* Curl or wget
* Git

##### Note: All this is installed on Mac OS X (Yosemite and El capitan), but you should consider it in given case that is not 
on your computer.

#### Step 1

##### Install OhMyZsh via curl or wget

In the terminal, copy one of the two following links, after that, press enter and waiting a few minutes while all 
dependencies are installed.
curl:

```sh -c "$(curl -fsSL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"```


```wget:sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"```

#### Step 2

##### Change theme in file ~/.zsh

Edit this file with the following command in your terminal:

```sudo vim ~/.zshrc```

Or use nano

```sudo nano ~/.zshrc```

After, you should find this line `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` and change the name of theme, 
I recommend using smt `ZSH_THEME="smt"` but, you feel free for chose another theme 
[here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes) and save changes.

#### Step 3 

##### Download and config the profile for terminal

**a)** Dowload profile for zsh: [solarized](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized)  (You can chose another profile)

**b)** Import the profile (.terminal file) Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > Import... in the bottom of list.

**c)** Set as default the profile installed and restart your terminal.


Finally, we have a beautiful terminal. Happy Coding!
